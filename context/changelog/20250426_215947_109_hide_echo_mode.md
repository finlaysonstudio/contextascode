# hide echo mode

echo mode passes output to `echo` instead of `aider`.
I want to disable this mode and pass to aider by default.
To turn on echo mode I want the env var set to true or 1.
The other way to turn on echo mode is to pass the --dry-run flag.

Read the plan to understand the full context.

Update the file and test.
