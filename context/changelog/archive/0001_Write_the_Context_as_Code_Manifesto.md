# "Context as Code"

In the era of code generators:
(a) prompt libraries describing conventions will be as essential to the development process as any framework 
(b) the context used in generation should be preserved as part of the history

Make a new file, README.md, written in the style of a concise, modern manifesto like the Agile Manifesto.
I want the definition to be permissive and generic, relying on “should” and “may” rather than “must” and “not.” 
Projects should explore different implementations and different tools.
External forces like markets will determine winners.

End the file with "Generated with 🩶 under the MIT License."
