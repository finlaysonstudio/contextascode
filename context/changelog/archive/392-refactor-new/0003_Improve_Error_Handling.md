# "Improve Error Handling" Task üéüÔ∏è

<Description>
Enhance error reporting with more contextual information and reconsider the use of process.exit() in library code.
</Description>

<Details>
The current implementation uses process.exit() directly in the library code and has limited error context. This task involves:

1. Replace direct process.exit() calls with proper error throwing:
   - Create custom error classes if needed (e.g., `ValidationError`, `FileSystemError`)
   - Throw errors instead of calling process.exit()

2. Add more context to error messages:
   - Include file paths in error messages
   - Provide more specific error messages based on the operation that failed
   - Include original error information when catching and rethrowing

3. Implement centralized error handling at the CLI entry point:
   - Handle errors at the top level
   - Format error messages appropriately for CLI output
   - Set appropriate exit codes based on error types

4. Add logging for debugging purposes.

This will make the code more reusable as a library and provide better feedback to users when errors occur.
</Details>

<Tests>
1. Verify that appropriate errors are thrown instead of calling process.exit().
2. Test error scenarios to ensure they provide helpful context.
3. Confirm that the CLI still exits with non-zero status codes on errors.
4. Check that error messages are user-friendly and actionable.
</Tests>

<Results>
Implemented improved error handling with the following changes:

1. Created custom error classes:
   - Added `CliError` as a base class
   - Added `ValidationError` for input validation failures
   - Added `FileSystemError` for file system operation failures
   - Added `UserCancellationError` for user cancellations

2. Replaced direct process.exit() calls:
   - Modified `handleNewCommand` to throw errors instead of calling process.exit()
   - Added proper error handling in helper functions

3. Added more context to error messages:
   - FileSystemError now includes file paths in error messages
   - Added original error information when catching and rethrowing

4. Implemented centralized error handling:
   - Added `handleCliError` function in index.ts
   - Updated command handlers to use the centralized error handler
   - Added appropriate exit codes based on error types
   - Added conditional stack trace display based on environment

The code is now more reusable as a library and provides better feedback to users when errors occur.
