# "Initialize Project Structure" Task üéüÔ∏è

<Description>
Initialize the project structure and root package.json for the TypeScript monorepo.
</Description>

<Details>
1. Create the project directory structure:
   - packages/
   - packages/cli/
   - packages/cli/src/

2. Initialize the root package.json with:
   - name: "@contextascode/monorepo"
   - private: true
   - workspaces: ["packages/*"]
   - type: "module"
   - Add scripts according to the ideal project structure

3. Initialize the CLI package.json with:
   - name: "@contextascode/cli"
   - type: "module"
   - Add scripts according to the ideal project structure
</Details>

<Tests>
- Verify the directory structure exists
- Verify package.json files contain the correct configuration
- Verify workspaces are properly configured
</Tests>

---

<Results>
Created the following structure:
- package.json (root)
- packages/cli/package.json
- packages/cli/src/index.ts
- packages/cli/src/cli.ts

Root package.json configured with:
- name: "@contextascode/monorepo"
- private: true
- workspaces: ["packages/*"]
- type: "module"
- Common scripts that delegate to workspaces

CLI package.json configured with:
- name: "@contextascode/cli"
- type: "module"
- Appropriate scripts for building, testing, linting
- Basic CLI entry point structure

All tests pass:
- Directory structure created
- Package.json files properly configured
- Workspaces correctly set up
</Results>

<Verified>
I've verified the task completion by checking:

1. Directory structure:
   - Confirmed the existence of packages/cli/src/ directory structure
   - Confirmed the presence of index.ts and cli.ts files in the src directory

2. Package.json configurations:
   - Root package.json has correct configuration:
     - name: "@contextascode/monorepo"
     - private: true
     - workspaces: ["packages/*"]
     - type: "module"
   - CLI package.json has correct configuration:
     - name: "@contextascode/cli"
     - type: "module"
     - Appropriate scripts

3. Workspace setup:
   - Verified the workspace configuration in root package.json
   - Confirmed the CLI package is properly set up as a workspace package

All tests pass and the project structure has been successfully initialized according to the requirements.
