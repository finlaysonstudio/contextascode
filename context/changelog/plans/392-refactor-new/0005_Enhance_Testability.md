# "Enhance Testability" Task üéüÔ∏è

<Description>
Decouple file system operations to improve unit testing capabilities.
</Description>

<Details>
The current implementation directly uses fs functions, making it difficult to test without mocking the entire fs module. This task involves:

1. Create a FileSystem service/adapter:
   ```typescript
   interface FileSystemAdapter {
     exists(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
     readFile(path: string, encoding: string): Promise<string>;
     writeFile(path: string, content: string): Promise<void>;
     mkdir(path: string, options?: { recursive: boolean }): Promise<void>;
   }
   
   class NodeFileSystemAdapter implements FileSystemAdapter {
     // Implementation using fs/promises
   }
   ```

2. Inject the FileSystem adapter into functions that need file operations:
   ```typescript
   export async function handleNewCommand(
     type: NewCommandType,
     description?: string,
     fileSystem: FileSystemAdapter = new NodeFileSystemAdapter()
   ): Promise<void> {
     // Use fileSystem instead of fs directly
   }
   ```

3. Create a mock FileSystem adapter for testing:
   ```typescript
   class MockFileSystemAdapter implements FileSystemAdapter {
     // In-memory implementation for testing
   }
   ```

4. Update tests to use the mock adapter.

This will make the code more testable and allow for easier mocking of file system operations.
</Details>

<Tests>
1. Create unit tests that use a mock FileSystem adapter.
2. Verify that tests can run without actual file system access.
3. Test edge cases that would be difficult to set up with real files.
4. Confirm that both "change" and "prompt" commands still work with the real adapter.
</Tests>
