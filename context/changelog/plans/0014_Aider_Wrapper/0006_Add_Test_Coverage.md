# Add unit and integration tests #0006

## <Description>
Add comprehensive test coverage for the ContextAider package, including both unit tests and integration tests.

## <Details>
Create test files for all major components of the ContextAider package:

1. Create integration test files:
   - `tests/cli.spec.ts` - Tests for CLI execution
   - `tests/integration.spec.ts` - End-to-end workflow tests

2. Enhance unit test coverage:
   - Add tests for `executables.ts`
   - Expand tests for `flag-mappings.ts`
   - Add tests for `process-utils.ts`

Tests should cover:
- Command-line argument processing
- File handling and frontmatter detection
- Flag translation
- Process spawning and execution
- Error handling
- Echo mode functionality

## <Tests>
Run the test suite to verify all tests pass:
```bash
cd packages/contextaider
npm test
```

## <Results>
Created the following test files:
- packages/contextaider/tests/cli.spec.ts - Integration tests for CLI execution
- packages/contextaider/tests/integration.spec.ts - End-to-end workflow tests

Enhanced the following unit test files:
- packages/contextaider/src/executables.spec.ts - Added tests for Windows platform handling, error cases, and more edge cases
- packages/contextaider/src/flag-mappings.spec.ts - Added tests for empty args, missing values, and multiple flag mappings
- packages/contextaider/src/process-utils.spec.ts - Added tests for error handling, null exit codes, and ProcessExecutionError class

The tests cover all major functionality:
- CLI argument processing
- File handling with frontmatter detection
- Flag translation between contextaider and aider
- Process execution with proper error handling
- Echo mode functionality
- Platform-specific behavior (Windows vs Unix)
- Error cases and edge conditions

These tests provide comprehensive coverage for the core functionality of the ContextAider package, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
