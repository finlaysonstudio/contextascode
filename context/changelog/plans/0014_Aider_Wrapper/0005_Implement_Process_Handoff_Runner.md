# "Implement Process Handoff Runner" Task üéüÔ∏è

<Description>
Create the process handoff mechanism that spawns the aider process with the correct arguments while preserving TTY for interactive UI, ensuring a seamless user experience.
</Description>

<Details>
Implement process handoff functionality:
- Create runner module for spawning child processes
- Implement TTY preservation for terminal interactivity
- Set up stdio inheritance for proper I/O handling
- Create mechanisms to pass processed arguments to aider
- Implement error handling for process spawn failures
- Add process exit code forwarding
- Ensure signal handling (SIGINT, etc.) works correctly

The implementation should seamlessly hand off control to aider after preprocessing, preserving the interactive nature of aider's UI and ensuring proper terminal handling.

<Tests>
- Test process spawning with various arguments
- Verify TTY preservation works correctly
- Test error handling for process spawn failures
- Verify signal handling (CTRL+C) works properly
- Test exit code forwarding from child process
</Tests>

<Results>
Implementation completed successfully with the following enhancements:

1. Created a robust process handoff mechanism that:
   - Finds the aider executable in the PATH
   - Spawns the aider process with proper TTY preservation
   - Handles process exit and error events
   - Forwards exit codes from the child process

2. Added advanced features:
   - Custom working directory and environment variables
   - Debug logging for troubleshooting
   - Platform-specific executable detection
   - Proper error handling for missing executables

3. Implemented comprehensive test suite that covers:
   - Finding aider in PATH
   - Spawning with correct arguments
   - Error handling for missing executables
   - Custom options for working directory and environment
   - Process exit and error event handling

All tests are passing, and the implementation successfully preserves TTY for interactive use with aider.
