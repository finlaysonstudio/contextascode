# "Configure Build and Workspace Scripts" Task üéüÔ∏è

<Description>
Set up build, workspace, and package scripts to ensure proper building, testing, and publishing of the ContextAider package within the monorepo structure.
</Description>

<Details>
Configure build and workspace scripts:
- Update package.json scripts for building, testing, and type checking
- Set up proper ESM module building with Vite
- Configure TypeScript declaration file generation
- Implement chmod +x for the CLI executable in the build process
- Set up workspace-level scripts for coordinated operations
- Configure package files array for proper npm publishing
- Ensure proper ESM module resolution in the build output

The configuration should enable seamless building, testing, and publishing of the package while maintaining proper ESM module support and TypeScript type definitions.

<Results>
Successfully configured build and workspace scripts for the ContextAider package:

1. Updated packages/contextaider/package.json:
   - Added comprehensive scripts for building, testing, linting, and development
   - Added necessary devDependencies for TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, and rimraf

2. Updated root package.json:
   - Added workspace-aware scripts specifically for the contextaider package
   - Created shortcuts for building, testing, and cleaning the contextaider package
   - Added development mode scripts for contextaider

3. Enhanced Vite configuration:
   - Improved external dependencies handling to include all Node.js built-ins
   - Added sourcemap generation for better debugging
   - Disabled minification for better readability of the output
   - Configured emptyOutDir to ensure clean builds
   - Expanded test coverage configuration

4. Enhanced the README.md file for the contextaider package:
   - Added more detailed installation and usage instructions
   - Documented exec mode with examples

   - Added information about aider dependency

All tests pass successfully:
- Build script produces the expected output files with proper structure
- TypeScript declaration files are generated correctly
- The CLI executable has the proper permissions after build
- ESM imports work correctly in the built package

The configuration now supports a smooth development workflow for the contextaider package within the monorepo structure, with proper building, testing, and publishing capabilities.
